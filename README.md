SE 616 | Project materials for Introduction to Software Engineering

## Abstract:
There are marketplaces that now exist on various platforms to give-away or barter for things that would otherwise be discarded. There are several programs that have cropped up and co-opted on centralized social media channel which are often opaque and do not offer specific features facilitating such a service to it's users.

Kintsugi is a product that aims to create a service that exclusively deals in reducing waste of individuals by either bartering it for something that they need or simply giving it away.

There are several pain points of using a centralized social media site to run a service like this and the product aims to resolve them in the following ways

                                            Pain-point	                                     Resolving Strategy
Currently all orgs and groups are separate and exclusive	Build at community level rather than at user level
User privacy for transactions that possibly take place at their home with strangers	Details will be given out only after user shows interest and has agreed to meet
Users need to know which private groups to join AND/OR have transit reach to pick up/deliver products	Discoverability will be at transit distance comfortable to users
